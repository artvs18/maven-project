# Gitlab CI/CD for simple Java project with maven build tool and automatic notifications to Telegram

It is a simple project that demonstrates how to use Maven to create and manage a Java project.

The project contains the following files:
- pom.xml: This is the main configuration file for the project. It contains information about the project, such as its name, version, dependencies, and plugins.
- src/main/java: This directory contains all of the Java source code for the project.
- src/test/java: This directory contains all of the unit tests for the project. 
- target: This directory contains all of the compiled classes and other artifacts generated by Maven during the build process. 

To build and run this project, you will need to have Maven installed on your system. To build the project, simply run `mvn package` from within the root directory of this repository. To run it, execute `java -jar target/maven-project-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

This project provides a CI/CD pipeline for Maven projects using GitLab. The pipeline will automatically build, test, and deploy your project on each commit or push to the repository. It also includes a set of pre-defined jobs to help you get started quickly.

You can set up notifications to be sent to Telegram whenever a job fails or succeeds. This way, you can stay informed of the status of your project and take action quickly if needed.

The CI/CD pipeline consists of the following stages: 
- Build: This stage will compile your source code and run any tests associated with it. 
- Test: This stage will execute any automated tests that have been defined in the project. 
- Deploy: This stage will deploy your application to the specified environment. 
- Notify: This stage will notify you by Telegram bot if one of the stages are failed.

The provided jobs are configured to run in the order listed above, but can be customized as needed. Additionally, you can add custom jobs to the pipeline to perform additional tasks such as running static code analysis or deploying to multiple environments. 

By using this CI/CD pipeline, you can ensure that your project is always up-to-date and running smoothly with each commit or push to the repository.
